# A/B Img Gen

A simple, fast tool to create side-by-side comparison images for social media polls and design feedback. Upload two screenshots (Version A and Version B) and instantly generate a clean, labeled image ready for sharing.

## Launch

This project was first launched on Peerlist when I got the idea for it at midnight. It managed to reach in the **top 25** projects of the Week and gathered a total **40 upvotes**.

## ✨ Features

- Effortless Upload: Drag, click, or paste screenshots directly from your clipboard.

- Customizable Labels: Automatically tags your designs as A and B with clean typography (Inter, System UI, SF Pro, and more).

- Preserves Quality: Images maintain their original aspect ratio and crispness.

- Instant Preview: See exactly how your comparison post will look before you download.

- One-Click Download: Get your ready-to-post image for immediate use.

## 🚀 How It Works

A/B Img Gen makes it frictionless to get feedback. Instead of manual editing, simply upload your two UI designs, and the tool will handle the rest, generating a perfectly aligned and labeled comparison image in seconds.

It's the perfect tool for designers, developers, and product managers who want to spark engagement and get fast, shareable comparisons.
